# PySpark-Project - BigDataEngineering
This project was a major part of a course I took - "Big Data Engineering" at TAUâ€™s Faculty of Engineering, during the 3rd year of my studies (2025).

The project has been the 2nd course assignment. Along with my 2 partners, we focused on querying big data using PySpark in Databricks. The task involved running PySpark queries over a large U.S. flight dataset, involving concepts such as lazy operations and DAGs.
